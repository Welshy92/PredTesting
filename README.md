This is me testing some stuff to keep my predictive analytics skills up to par. This is a short project project doing some very basic data analysis. THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

Some commands for me to remember:

* jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' (if using from an online IDE. VScode can just open the file or use CTRL+SHIFT=P and make a new notebook.)
* pip install -r requirements.txt or pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade for latest versions
* pip freeze > requirements.txt

Consider keeping your terminal requirements seperate to your jupyter notebook requirements. (I had A LOT of things spefically for VScode that wouldn't be required at all in the notebook).
