This is me testing some stuff to keep my predictive analytics skills up to par.

Some commands for me to remember:

* jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' (if using from an online IDE VScode can just open the file or use CTRL+SHIFT=P and make a new notebook.)
* pip install -r requirements.txt or pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade for latest versions
* pip freeze > requirements.txt
